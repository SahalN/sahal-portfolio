### Project Name

Kliniku

### Short Description

Kliniku is an application that streamlines the process of scheduling doctor appointments through a user-friendly dashboard, simplifying the reservation process for both patients and doctors.

### Purpose and Background

Kliniku was developed to address the need for an efficient and accessible way to book medical appointments. The platform aims to reduce scheduling complications and improve the overall experience for patients, while providing healthcare providers with an organized and manageable appointment system.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js with Mongoose and Express for API and server management.
- **Frontend:** React.js for an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Database:** MongoDB for flexible, scalable data storage.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure access control, with `moment` for time management and `bcryptjs` for password encryption.
- **Version Control:** Git for tracking changes and managing code effectively.

### Key Features

- **Admin and User Login:** Separate login portals for administrators and regular users, providing secure access control for different user roles.
- **Doctor and Patient Reservations:** Allows easy booking and management of appointments for both doctors and patients.
- **Profile Updates:** Enables users to update their profiles with essential personal and medical information.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was ensuring secure and smooth authentication for both admins and users. This was achieved by implementing JWT for access control and using `bcryptjs` for secure password encryption, which added an extra layer of security to the application.

### Roles and Responsibilities

As the lead developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing both backend and frontend components, setting up the database, coding core functionalities, and ensuring secure data management.

### Outcomes and Impact

The project was completed within one month and successfully provides users with an efficient scheduling system. Early feedback highlighted the ease of use and accessibility of the platform, with significant improvements in appointment management for healthcare providers.

### Future Development

Future plans include integrating appointment reminders via SMS or email, expanding user profile capabilities, and adding a feedback system for patients to review their appointment experiences.

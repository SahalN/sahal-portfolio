### Project Name

Bookshelf API

### Short Description

A RESTful API designed to manage bookshelves and their contents, deployed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This API allows users to create, read, update, and delete bookshelf and book records.

### Purpose and Background

Developed as part of the Bangkit program, this project demonstrates how to build and deploy a full-featured API using Google Cloud services. The API offers a platform for managing books and bookshelves, with focus on efficient backend design and cloud deployment.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Node.js
- **Backend Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** Google Cloud Firestore
- **Cloud Deployment:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **API Architecture:** RESTful

### Key Features

- CRUD operations for books and bookshelves, including filtering and sorting.
- Data is stored and managed in Google Cloud Firestore, ensuring scalability.
- API is fully documented and follows REST best practices.
- Deployed and managed using GCP, ensuring reliability and performance.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Ensuring scalable and reliable data storage.  
  **Solution:** Used Google Cloud Firestore to take advantage of its flexibility, scalability, and integration with other GCP services.

- **Challenge:** Optimizing API responses and performance under high traffic.  
  **Solution:** Applied proper indexing and optimized database queries in Firestore, combined with caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

### Outcomes and Impact

- Delivered a fully functional, scalable API that allows users to manage books and bookshelves with secure access.
- Demonstrated best practices in API design, cloud deployment, and backend management.
